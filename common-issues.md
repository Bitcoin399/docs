# Encode address
 
How do I decode/encode an address?

    An address comes in 2 forms:
        1) encoded, 58 byte, looks something like `7K5TT4US7M3FM7L3XBJXSXLJGF2WCXPBV2YZJJO2FH46VCZOS3ICJ7E4QU`
        2) decoded, 32 byte, looks something like `0xfabb39f292fb36567d7bb853795d693175615de1aeb194a5da29f9ea8b2e96d0` as hexadecimal

    You can translate from one to the other by using the SDK supplied methods. 
    
    For example, in python `encoding.encode_address` will convert the 32 byte version to the encoded 58 byte version and `encoding.decode_address` will perform the opposite translation.

    All SDKs have a similarly named method.

    !! Note that smart contracts operate _only_ on the 32 byte version, so any interaction where an address is used should be translated prior to passing it to the smart contract. This is handled for you automatically in some cases (e.g. sender on a transaction)

# Decode state

How do I decode state values?

When calling the API for global or local state, the result returned is in the form of an array of state values. Each entry in the array represents a key/value pair in global or local state. To decode the key or bytes value, just base64 decode the string into bytes, then encode the bytes in whatever format is required. 

examples:
    for a simple string, just encode it as `ascii` or `utf-8`
    for an address call `encode_address` or similar depending on SDK
    for an abi tuple like `(address,uint64,bool)` use `ABIType.from_string("(address,uint64,bool)").decode(value_bytes)` 


```ts
    interface StateValue {
      // The base64 encoded key for this state value
      key: string;
      // The value as a sort of union type
      value: {
        // if set, the base64 encoded bytes for the state value
        bytes: string;
        // if set, the number stored in state 
        uint: number;
        // 1 for bytes, 2 for uint
        type?: number;
        // Only set in the eval deltas, describes delete/set
        action?: number;
      };
    }
```


# What is this 400 error?

A 400 error typically occurs because there was some issue with the transactions. The exact reason will depend on the circumstances but the error message will contain more information.

Common reasons include:

- `transaction already in ledger: ...`

    This happens when resending a transaction that has already been approved. To make the transaction unique, add a nonce to the notefield or change the valid rounds.

- `underflow on subtracting SEND_AMOUNT from sender amount AVAILABLE_AMOUNT`, `account ADDRESS balance 0 below min XXX (N assets)`

    All of these happen when the some account does not have enough algos to cover the transaction (taking into account their minimum balance requirement and any other transaction in the same group). Fund the account if necessary or cover the fees from its transactions with another transaction in the group.

- `receiver error: must optin, asset ASSET_ID missing from ACCOUNT_ADDR`

    This happens when the intended receiver of some asset hasn't opted in. 

- `should have been authorized by ADDR1 but was actually authorized by ADDR2`
    This happens when the wrong signer is used to sign a transaction.

- `TransactionPool.Remember: txn dead: round XXXXXXXX outside of XXXXXXXX--XXXXXXXX`

    This happens when trying to submit a transaction outside its validity window, transactions may only have up to 1000 rounds between first/last valid round and the current round must be
somewhere between first/last valid.


- `fee N below threshold M`

    This happens when the fee attached to a transaction (or transaction group) is not sufficient to cover the fees for the transaction. 

- `only clearing out is supported for applications that have been deleted`

    This happens when an attempt is made to call an application that no longer exists

- `this transaction should be issued by the manager. It is issued by ADDR`

    This happens when trying to issue an asset config transaction by an account that is _not_ the manager account for the asset

- `cannot close asset ID in allocating account`

    This happens when the creator of an asset tries to close out of the asset. 

- `check failed on ApprovalProgram: program version N greater than protocol supported version M`

    This happens when trying to create an application with a version that is not yet supported by the protocol. 
    If this happens on your local sandbox, set the protocol version to `future` to get access to the latest changes.

- `cannot clear state: ADDR is not currently opted in to app N`

    This happens when an account that is not opted in to an application tries to opt out or clear state for that app.


# Logic errors

How can I debug this logic error?

Generally Logic errors can be debugged using [Dryrun](link) or [Tealdbg](link) or [Simulate](link). link to debugging page 

For some common errors, find an explanation below:  

-  `logic eval error: invalid {Asset|App|Account|Box} reference` 

    This happens when the reference is not passed in the app call transactions in the appropriate reference field. By passing a reference in the transaction, the node is able to quickly load the reference into memory and have it available for the AVM runtime to consult quickly.


- `logic eval error: assert failed pc=XXX`

    An assert was called on something that evaluated to 0. The pc will provide a pointer to where in the program the assert failed.


- `logic eval error: program logs too large.`

    Max 1k of logs, max called 32 times per app caall

- `logic eval error: write budget (N) exceeded`, `logic eval error: box read budget (N) exceeded`

    More box refs == more IO budget


- `logic eval error: store TYPE count N exceeds schema TYPE count M`

    Schema needs to be large enough to allow storage requirements. immutable so need to recreate app

- `logic eval error: err opcode executed.`

    Unless you added an `err` to your program explicitly, its likely this is the result of the internal routing of the app finding that there are no matching routes for some conditional block. Typically this happens when something like the abi method selector passed is not present in the application.

- `logic eval error: overspend` 
- `logic eval error: * overflowed.`
- `logic eval error: invalid ApplicationArgs index 0.`
